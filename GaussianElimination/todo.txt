Features 🎬:
    High priorty:
        text when hovering for: view 1, view 2, clear all, undo last, apply new row operation, default zoom, animate steps

    Medium priority:
        (Medium) Add minimzation of matricies (Make button work)

    Low priority:

        (Medium) When solution is out of the 10x10x10 grid show warning

        (Medium) When someone goes to page do one draw operation and time it and give reccomended fps.
        
        (Hard) Save steps in ? url
        
        (Hard) BE ABLE TO SAVE SOLUTOIN AS LATEX / SAVE AS IMAGE / SAVE AS TEXT

        🧙‍♂️ (Medium) Make the matrix look a little better

        allow for [[],[],[]] input field at the top bar of input matrix? and to be able to copy a step i as this format.

Linear Transformations page brainstorm 🧠:
    Three different sections:
        left: equations
        mid: graph
        right: question problems directory

    Question directory:
        All on same page, questions go down out like directory,
        when click on question hide directory and show questio info and stuff and have back arrow to go back to directory

    Equations:
        Coppy desmos ideas
        Both "direct" and or "formated" matrix input

        Demo:
            A = [[],[],[]] (Not graphed)
            v = [1,2,3]    (Graphed)
            Av             (Graphed)
            m = Av         (Graphed)

        If output is a vector or pedefined shape it gets graphed. Otherwise it doesn't.
        There is option not to graph

Bugs 🐛:
    If zoomed in and add new row operation the page scrolls in an odd way.

    Error Line 413 in gaussianElim script, cannot get classlist from null, don't know how to trigger this...
