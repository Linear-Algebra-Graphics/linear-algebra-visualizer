Features 🎬:
    High priorty:
        (Medium) Finish up matrix stuff so it works.
                    E.g when matrix is typed in show the solution.

    Medium priority:
        (Medium) MAKE LAST MATRIX HAVE REMOVE BUTTON OR HAVE REMOVE LAST OPERATION BUTTON OR SOMETHING
                Remove all as well (Maybe)

        (Hard) Add color picking page

        (Medium) Add minimzation of matricies (Make button work)

        (Easy) Make fractions on top left solution be on top of eachother

    Low priority:
        👀 (Hard) Animate between planes

        (Medium) Add settings page
        
        (Medium) ADD FPS CHANGE SETTINGS

        (Hard) BE ABLE TO SAVE SOLUTOIN AS LATEX / SAVE AS IMAGE / SAVE AS TEXT

        🧙‍♂️ (Medium) Make the matrix look a little better
        
        (Easy) Have base colors be color blind compatible

Linear Transformations page brainstorm 🧠:
    Three different sections:
        left: equations
        mid: graph
        right: question problems directory

    Question directory:
        All on same page, questions go down out like directory,
        when click on question hide directory and show questio info and stuff and have back arrow to go back to directory

    Equations:
        Coppy desmos ideas
        Both "direct" and or "formated" matrix input

        Demo:
            A = [[],[],[]] (Not graphed)
            v = [1,2,3]    (Graphed)
            Av             (Graphed)
            m = Av         (Graphed)

        If output is a vector or pedefined shape it gets graphed. Otherwise it doesn't.
        There is option not to graph

    Add minimzation of matricies (Make button work)

    Animate between planes

    Choose better font

Bugs 🐛:
    Zooming with scroll wheel is messed up. Zooming canvas should *only* zoom canvas.
        Track pad AND scroll wheel need help with this.

    If zoomed in and add new row operation the page scrolls in an odd way.

    Error Line 413 in gaussianElim script, cannot get classlist from null, don't know how to trigger this...

    Solution shower needs to update when editing the input matrix
