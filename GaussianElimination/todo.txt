Linear Transformations page brainstorm üß†:
    Three different sections:
        left: equations
        mid: graph
        right: question problems directory

    Question directory:
        All on same page, questions go down out like directory,
        when click on question hide directory and show questio info and stuff and have back arrow to go back to directory

    Equations:
        Coppy desmos ideas
        Both "direct" and or "formated" matrix input

        Demo:
            A = [[],[],[]] (Not graphed)
            v = [1,2,3]    (Graphed)
            Av             (Graphed)
            m = Av         (Graphed)

        If output is a vector or pedefined shape it gets graphed. Otherwise it doesn't.
        There is option not to graph
