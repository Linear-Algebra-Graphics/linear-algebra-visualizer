    Three different sections:
        left: equations
        mid: graph
        right: question problems directory

    Question directory:

        Coppy desmos ideas
        Both "direct" and or "formated" matrix input

        Demo:
            A = [[],[],[]] (Not graphed)
            v = [1,2,3]    (Graphed)
            Av             (Graphed)
            m = Av         (Graphed)

        If output is a vector or pedefined shape it gets graphed. Otherwise it doesn't.
