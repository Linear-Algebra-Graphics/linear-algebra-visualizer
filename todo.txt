    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation

Make so basis is always same size doesn't get scaled (Still gets rotated and stuff)

FIX GLICH WHERE MANY ZOOM INS ON CHROME BREAKS VECTORS
(We think its when you draw way outside the canvas)

Add way to add lines and stuff with mouse

IDEA? Have slider on the side of the graph change x y and z rotation

CHANGE CHECKBOXES SO SEE IF CHECKED RATHER THAN ONCLICK

add random vector function

Fix numbers because they are totalloy broken

Fix decieml numbers so looks right. Now its odd.
