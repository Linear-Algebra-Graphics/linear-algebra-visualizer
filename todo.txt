Short term:

Add transformations
set graph size relative to screen size???
NEED DARKMODE BUTTON
Add grid numbers

Long term:

Add a hard limit to all while loops so it doesn't crash browswer

Change rotation:
    https://www.xarg.org/2021/07/trackball-rotation-using-quaternions/
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation

Make so basis is always same size doesn't get scaled (Still gets rotated and stuff)

FIX GLICH WHERE MANY ZOOM INS ON CHROME BREAKS VECTORS
(We think its when you draw way outside the canvas)

Add way to add lines and stuff with mouse

IDEA? Have slider on the side of the graph change x y and z rotation

CHANGE CHECKBOXES SO SEE IF CHECKED RATHER THAN ONCLICK

add random vector function

Fix numbers because they are totalloy broken

Fix decieml numbers so looks right. Now its odd.

gaussian Elim tab
1. Have button switch center to intersection
2. no solution case?? forget it until prof gives us gold


perhaps sort all by z values before drawing for all of them?

Transpose:
    Change name to transpsoeMatrix
    Make it work for non square matries

Use factory functions!!!!!

Should we animate between gaussian elimination steps???
